You can then easily use the screwdriver to take it down again with one use. This allows you to access vents without the need to use a Fake Vent Cover. The alternative of using a file, Plastic Knife or Flimsy Cutters to break into a vent will not give you back the original cover, forcing you to craft a fake vent cover to avoid being sent to solitary if a guard spots the open vent. Although you can pick up and place a fake vent cover without the need for a tool, it has limited durability, and will break with repeated use. You can repeatedly unscrew and replace the original vent cover as long as your screwdriver holds up. Be careful not to use your screwdriver up after placing down the vent cover and getting yourself stuck in the vents or block yourself out of the vents. If this happens, since the vent cover will only have 5% durability after being placed back down it can easily be cut with another tool in the event of an emergency, but then the vent cover will be destroyed and you will need to replace it with a fake vent cover.",

Your Guard Heat will very slowly increase while wearing a Guard Outfit in sight of a guard, precisely by 3% a second in the Escapists 1 and 1% around every 2 seconds in the Escapists 2. While wearing the Guard Outfit, the following benefits are gained. If the player's heat rises above 90% (TE1) / 80% (TE2) a Guard Outfit will not prevent the player from being attacked by guards/shot by snipers. The Guard Outfit can be crafted with the following recipe: Additionally, in TE1, there are other ways to obtain it. It can be purchased or rarely found in desks. It is one of the two outfits that can be obtained by working in the Laundry. Since the Laundry job almost always has a contraband detector, the player will either need to use a Contraband Pouch or get it through by wearing it. In TE2, it can be required for the \"Fashion Victim\" Favour.",
